# PX912_Solids

Code for PX912 mini_project

### FEM_func.py:
Contains all functions used to calculate the Jacobian, shape function derivatives and strain-displacement matricies for elements. Also contains Linear elasticity model (plane strain) and given mesh tool.

### plotting.py:
Contains all functions used to perform plotting of meshes and contours in project.ipynb

### project.ipynb: 
Main code that sets up and solves th finite element problem. Key data is written to the Data_and_Analysis folder.

### Data_and_Analysis/Analysis.ipynb:
Notebook which contains the analysis of the FEM data (i.e to observe nodal displacement and elemental stress/strain convergence).
